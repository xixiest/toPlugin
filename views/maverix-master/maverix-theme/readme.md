Maverix
=======

### What is Maverix?

Maverix is a maccish bootstrap theme and application boilerplate. It gives your web-apps a native look and feel and bundles AngularJS and other components such as jQuery, Flot and rangeslider.js

It is perfect to be used for apps that are based on HTML App Containers such as:

- [MacGap](https://github.com/maccman/macgap)
- [Node-Webkit](https://github.com/rogerwang/node-webkit)
- [Github Atom Shell](https://github.com/atom/atom-shell)
- [Adobe Brackets Shell](https://github.com/adobe/brackets-shell)

### Design Decisions
Closest possible to native
All controls and Elements are carefully designed to perfectly fit into the native mac environment.

#### Non Responsive (for now...)
Desktop Apps don't need to run on thousands of different devices and viewports. You are the master of setting a minimum-viewport and the app won't get smaller than this. If you are using Maverix Theme in a traditional web-app it is also okay for Admin Backends that don't need responsive layout.

#### Built on Bootstrap and Less
Twitters Bootstrap comes bundled with tons of useful styles and add ons and allows beginners and masters to get started quickly (grid positioning, etc.). The maverix styles are enhancing bootstrap and are written in less.css

#### Webkit first
Maverix Theme is primarily made to enable app container based web-apps to look like native OS X Apps. So webkit is the primary engine when releasing new components. However this doesn't mean that other browsers are totally unsupported. Maverix Theme is tested on Safari, Firefox and Chrome on OS X.

#### Bundled with AngularJS
AngularJS is one of the best Javascript App Frameworks available today and so Maverix Theme comes bundled with AngularJS including fully working routing to get you started fast. Anyways, AngularJS usage is optional.

### Roadmap
- Bugfix requests are priority one.
- New Features will be added as far as they make sense.
- If demand is high for responsive design I will add it.
